# Motivation

If I had a dollar for every time I complain about the legacy database the
company has been using being the bottleneck of the whole system... The aim 
of this project is to show a practical way to scale the persistence layer of
multi module systems with **Kafka Connect**. As "_microservices architectures_"
rise with their impacable glory, the amount of time spent on the cable has
shared the same glory with its creator. Consecutively, applications' being close 
to the data has become more and more significant. In-memory for the rescue
right.

The things that I applied for this project may not be suitable for certain
cases, and by "certain" I mean "most" of the enterprise solutions, but they
were fun to implement anyway.

This repository consists code implementations that I referred in my 2 part
Medium story. You can find the articles ðŸ‘‰[here](https://medium.com/@itwasneo/scale-your-database-with-kafka-connect-part-1-f07fc6a1cffe) and [here](https://medium.com/@itwasneo/scale-your-db-with-kafka-connect-part-2-716edf8f2770). ðŸ‘ˆ
